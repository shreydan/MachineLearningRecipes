In this tutorial, we:

    1. Imported a dataset from scikit-learn, specifically _Iris Flower Dataset._
    2. Train a Decision Tree Classifier.
    3. Predict label (which type of Iris flower it is) for a new flower.
    4. Visualize the classifier tree (how it made its decisions) in `visualize.py`
     
For more details, check out `classify.py` with detailed comments.

Thanks to [Amruth Pillai](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/MachineLearningRecipes) for iris.pdf
where you can easily visualize the decision-making process of the classifier.
